In this post we shall explore expectation maximization, a mathematical tool used in many generative-ai algorithms, in detail.  

Probability: Chance of occurance of an event.   
Probability distribution: A mathematical function tha gives probabilities of all the possible outcomes of an experiment. The sum of all outcomes must sum to 1.  
Likelihood: If the paramter of a distribution model are represented as $$ \Theta $$, then the likehood function is the joint probability of all the observed data points as a function of $$ \Theta $$ i.e. it outputs the likeliness of different values of the parameter $$ \Theta $$ to model the distribution from which the observed data could be sampled.
