I this post we shall explore expectation maximization, a mathematical tool used in many generative-ai algorithms, in detail.  

Probability: Chance of occurance of an event.
Probability distribution: A mathematical function tha gives probabilities of all the possible outcomes of an experiment. The sum of all outcomes must sum to 1.
Likelihood:  A mathematical function that outputs the probability of how likely a distribution is to produce set of sampled data points. If the paramters of the distribution are $$ \Theta $$ then the likehood function is the joint probability of all the observed data points as a function of $$ \Theta $$ i.e. it represents the likeliness of different parameters to represent the model of the distribution  from which teh observed data could be sampled.
