## 1. Introduction
The natural world around us is rife with examples of transformations applied to objects that retain some underlying property of the object before and after the transformation. For example, rigid motions in 3D-space that preserve a particular molecule.   A simple example is rotation of a 2-D square ( in XY plane ) about the Z axis. A 0, 90, 180 and 270 and 360 degree rotation has no impact on the square shape and orientation.  Such transformations are called ***symmetries***.Two symmetries can be combined to form another symmetry and every symmetry has an opposite or inverse symmetry. For instance,  90 and 180 degree rotation can be combined to produce a 270 degree rotation that does not change a square. Also,a  rotation counterclockwise by 90 degrees can be undone by rotation clockwise by 90 degrees. ***Groups*** are a collection of transformations that preserve some underlying structure of a set to  which they are applied.

Historically, the groups were not separate from their ***representation** as a set of transformations. However, in the late nineteenth century Cayley formulated an abstract definition of a group that separated it from it from its representation of a group of transformations, called ***tranformation groups*** . Representation theory aims to understand different ways in which abstract groups can be realized as set of transformations.
