### 1. Cosets
To understand what normal subgroups are, we first need to understand the concept of *Cosets*. Cosets are one of the basic tools to study groups. Informally, if there is a subgroup (H,*) of a group (G,*), the subgroup H divides the group G into disjoint sets of cardinality equal to the size of the subgroup H.
  
More formally,      
Let there be a Group (G,*) which contains a subgroup (H,*). Then for every element $$g \in G$$, the left coset is defined $$g*H$$ and the right coset is desined as $$H*g$$.  
  
Note, that :
- Subgroup H is also a left coset and right coset wherein $$g.H$$ and $$h.g$$, $$g $$ is the identity element of the subgroup G.
- a coset, barring the subgroup H is not a group, as it does not contain the identity element. The identity element is a part of the subgroup H.  
- The cardinality of a coset is same as  the cardinality of the subgroup H.
