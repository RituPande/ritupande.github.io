- A matrix is diagonalizable if it has full set of eignevectors i.e. an n x n eigenvector has n linearly independent eignevectors.
- A group of matrices are simultaneouly diagnonalizable if they are individually diagonalizable and mutually commute.
- The shift operator and its anjoint commute with ciruclant matrices. Rather it can be said that a matrix is circulant iff it communtes with the shift operator
- The shift operator is in some sense the most fundamental circulant matrix
- Circular convolution of two vectors a , v is defined as:
  a * v = circulant matrix(a) *v
  -  Circular convolution is associative and commutatiev
  -  i.e a * x = C_a  x = C_x a.
  -  C_ab =  C_a * C_b
  -  C_a C_b = C_b C_a

- A representation is said to be irreducible if all elements of rep(G)
cannot be simultaneously block diagonalized.
