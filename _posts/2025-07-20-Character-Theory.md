Character theory is a tool in  representation theory that allows study group representations using functions rather than matrices. These functions called  ***characters***, are much easier to handle but still encode a large amount of structural information about the group and its representations. A character is a function that maps each element of a group to a real/complex number, such that, group elements that perform same action ( under different perspectives) are assigned the same value, allowing similar elements to be identified easily. This  set of similar elements is called a ***conjucacy class***.

A conjugacy class is the group of elements that produce the $$\underline{same}$$ tranformation under differnet group perepectives (relabling of group elements) from group theoretic perepective,  or a different basis, from representation theoretic perspective.  In other words, a permutation (12) and (23) are same if the labeling of the elements in the group are changed. The permutation just swaps two numbers next to each other. Mathematically,  
  
$$g$$ and $$h^-{1}gh$$ belong to the same conjugacy class for every $$g , h \in G$$ , where $$h^-{1}gh$$ is a similarity transform of $$g$$ within group $$G$$
