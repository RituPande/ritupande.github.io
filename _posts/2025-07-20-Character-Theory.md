Character theory is a tool in  representation theory that allows study group representations using functions rather than matrices. These functions, the ***characters**, are much easier to handle but still encode a surprising amount of structural information about the group and its representations.

A character is a function that maps each element of a group to a real/complex number, such that, group elements belonging to the same *conjugacy class* produce the same output, allowing extraction of information about the nature group element from its character.

A conjucacy class is the group of elements that produce the $$\underline{same tranformation}$$ under differnet group perepectives (relabling of group elements) from group theoretic perepective or  a different basis from reprentation theoretic perspective.  In other words:    

$$g$$ and $$h^-{1}gh$$ belong to the same conjugacy class for every $$g , h \in G$$  
  
where $$h^-{1}gh$$ is a similarity transform of $$g$$ within group $$G$$
