Character theory is a tool in  representation theory that allows study group representations using functions rather than matrices. These functions, the ***characters**, are much easier to handle but still encode a surprising amount of structural information about the group and its representations.

A character is a function that maps each element of a group to a real/complex number, such that, group elements belonging to the same conjugacy class produce the same output, allowing extraction of information about the nature group element from its character.
