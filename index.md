I am Ritu Pande, an independent researcher, with interest in modelling biological processes using geometric deep learning. My interests also span creating frameworks that model biological processes as self-organising systems and researching  whether this throws any insight into diseases arising out of loss of system homeostatis. 

I am also a software architect with 20+ years of expertise in coding, designing, architecting and technically leading large teams to deliver and bring to production solutions for emdedded connected devices.
