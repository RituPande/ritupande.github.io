I am Ritu Pande, an independent researcher, with interest in modelling biological processes using geometric deep learning. My interests also span modelling biological processes as self-organising systems and researching  whether this throws any insight into diseases, such as, cancer or autoimmune disorders, arising out of loss of system homeostatis. 

I am also a software architect with 20+ years of expertise in designing cybersecurity solutions for connected devices.
