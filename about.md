Hi! I am Ritu Pande, an independent researcher, with interest in modelling biological processes using geometric deep learning. I am also interested in researching  whether modelling biological processes as self-organising systems produces any insight into diseases, such as, cancer or autoimmune disorders, arising out of loss of system homeostatis . 

I am also software architect with 20+ years of expertise in designing cybersecurity solutions for connected devices.
