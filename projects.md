### 1. Adaptive Traffic Signal Control Using Deep Reinforcement Learning  
Classical Traffic Signal Control uses fixed signal duration and sequence based on estimates of expected traffic on each intersection leg . In this project I explore the possibility of using deep reinforcement learning to adapt the traffic signal duration and sequence to changing traffic conditions autonomously.

### 2. Connectionist Temporal Classification: A Study  
In this project I explore the fundamentals of Connectionist Temporal Classification algorithm and how to use its Keras/Tensorflow implementation to break Captcha 2.0.To go to the project page click [here](https://ritupande.github.io/ctc/)
